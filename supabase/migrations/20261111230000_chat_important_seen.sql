-- The "1 important message" strip (#4186, slice 4 of #3921, Shawn's design).
--
-- spec/behavior/chat/README.md § Message flags owns the rule. A channel shows
-- a strip counting the Important messages the member hasn't seen, flagged in
-- the last 14 days. A message is seen once the member jumps to it, scrolls it
-- onto their screen, or dismisses the strip.
--
-- 1. `chat_message_important_seen`: one row per (member, message) the member
--    has seen. Per message rather than one timestamp per channel, because a
--    timestamp would let scrolling a newer Important message into view mark
--    an older one the member never saw. Rows exist only for messages someone
--    flagged Important and the member saw, so the table stays small. Once
--    seen, a message stays seen, even if its flag is removed and added again.
--    RLS on and no policies: API only (service role), like bookmarks.
-- 2. A partial index on `chat_messages` for the strip's one read: a
--    channel's live, Important, timeline messages by when they were flagged.
-- 3. `anonymize_user` also deletes the member's seen rows, as it does their
--    read receipts. Their `user_id` cascade never fires, because the `users`
--    row is tombstoned in place, not deleted.
--
-- Locks. Every migration file runs in one transaction, so each lock below is
-- held until commit. Creating the table touches nothing existing. The index
-- is built without CONCURRENTLY (impossible inside a transaction), so it takes
-- a SHARE lock on `chat_messages`: reads go on, but every insert, update and
-- delete on it (a send, an edit, a delete, a flag) waits until the file
-- commits. The index covers only Important rows, so the build is one scan of
-- `chat_messages` and a tiny sort. Redefining `anonymize_user` takes a lock on the function only.
-- Promote it outside the chapters' busy evening hours.

  -- and this scrub, is closed by the deletion flow's second, converging call
