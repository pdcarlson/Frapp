# Observability

## Structured Logging

Every API request is logged as structured JSON with: request ID, user ID, chapter ID, endpoint, HTTP method, status code, response latency, and timestamp.

**Identifier handling (internal logs):** `user_id` and `chapter_id` are retained as raw values in internal structured logs because the logs are confined to Frapp-internal observability tooling and operate under the internal retention policy. They are **not** PII-scrubbed at the log boundary — scrubbing applies only at external-reporting boundaries (Sentry / external observability vendors). Email addresses, IPs, auth tokens, request bodies, and response bodies are never logged.

## Request Tracing

A unique `x-request-id` header is generated for each incoming request (or preserved if the client sends one). This ID is included in all log entries and all error responses, enabling end-to-end tracing. The request ID itself is non-PII and may be surfaced in client-facing error messages.

## Health Check

`GET /health` returns service status, database connectivity, Supabase connectivity, and uptime. Used by monitoring tools and load balancers. No authentication required.

## Error Tracking

Integrate with Sentry (or equivalent). All unhandled exceptions and 5xx responses are reported with: request ID, endpoint, HTTP method, status code, and stack trace. External error reporting requires explicit PII handling:

- **Pseudonymized before sending:** `user_id` and `chapter_id` are sent as HMAC-SHA256 hashes using the same per-environment salt as the analytics pipeline (see [`data-retention.md`](data-retention.md) #analytics-events-pseudonymous). Reversing the hash requires access to the salt, which is held outside the error-reporting provider.
- **Redacted entirely:** email addresses, IP addresses, auth tokens (including any `Authorization` header value), request bodies, response bodies, message contents, document contents, and any free-text fields that may contain user-typed PII.

## Metrics

Key metrics exported for monitoring dashboards:

- Request rate (per endpoint, per status code).
- Error rate (4xx, 5xx).
- Response latency (p50, p95, p99).
- Active WebSocket / Realtime connections.
- Active study sessions.
- Push notification delivery success/failure rate.

## Alerting

Configurable alerts (via the monitoring provider) for:

- Error rate exceeds threshold (e.g. >5% 5xx in 5 minutes).
- API downtime (health check fails).
- Database connection pool exhaustion.
- Stripe webhook processing failures.
- Push notification delivery failure spike.
